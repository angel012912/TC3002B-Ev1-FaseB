The quest for new information is an inborn human trait and has always been quintessential for human survival and progress. Novelty drives curiosity, which in turn drives innovation. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Novelty Detection refers to finding text that has some new information to offer with respect to whatever is earlier seen or known. Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies ensure the ongoing development of micro- and macro-economic entities by focusing on the principles of interconnectivity, digitalization, and automation. Machine learning (ML) is a form of artificial intelligence which is placed to transform the twenty-first century. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) have revolutionized the field of advanced robotics in recent years. Adaptation and innovation are extremely important to the manufacturing industry. Commercial applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have made remarkable progress recently, particularly in areas such as image recognition, natural speech processing, language translation, textual analysis, and self-learning.
